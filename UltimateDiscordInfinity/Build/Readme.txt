Hi!
I made this game in 5 hours, so expect bugs and weirdness!

The game is simple; you're a ghost who just wants to listen to music, but music-eating drones from space are attacking you.
You have a health score at the top of the screen - shoot the drones to steal your music back, and try to survive for as long
as you can!
You have 3 bombs - bombs unleash a bunch of missiles at the robots, although they behave erratically. You can get more bombs
by scoring tons of points!
